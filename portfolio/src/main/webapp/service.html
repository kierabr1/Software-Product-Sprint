                    Broadening the tech world to underrepresented groups has always been something Iâ€™m passionate about. Accessibility and inclusion are extremely important. 
                    Since I first discovered that I wanted to pursue a career in tech, I knew that I would be working in an environment where both women and African Americans were underrepresented, as shown in the charts below. 
                    I wanted to do something to try and change that. One way to make an impact is by fighting the stereotypes surrounding tech and engineering through STEM education.
                    During my sophomore year at Howard University, I volunteered with NSBE Jr. by coaching a robotics team and co-teaching a programming course that was sponsored by Blacks at Microsoft. 
                    I also taught at NSBE SEEK which is a free summer program to help expose children from underrepresented groups to the vast world of engineering. 
                    In both of these programs, I fought to negate discouraging stereotypes of what kids think an engineer or computer scientist looks like.
                    By being a black woman in tech, I understand that I serve as a role model to others that plan to follow in similar footsteps.
